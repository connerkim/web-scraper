# web-scraper

## What it Does
### A simple web scraper in the form of a Google Chrome Extension. It has four elementary functions: wait, click, write, and read. The extension is meant to interact with any webpage using a simple interface in order to mine data from a webpage. It takes in a number of milliseconds (for wait function), or an HTML tag or id (for read and click). For the write function, it takes in an HTML tag or id and a string to replace it with.

## Why
### To explore interacting with webpages and continue to familiarize myself with JS and HTML. Additionally, to explore creating useful Chrome Extensions.

## How to Build
### Simply upload the files to a new Google Chrome Extension (navigate to chrome://extensions/ and choose "Load unpacked", then choose the file directory).
